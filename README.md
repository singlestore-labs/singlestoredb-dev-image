## How to run the Docker image?

This Docker image allows up to 4 leaf nodes to be run on a machine (host) that has up to 32 cores and up to 128GB of RAM without the need for a license.

When running a Docker container, either with or without a [free edition license](https://www.singlestore.com/self-managed-standard/), on a machine with:

* More than 32 cores, include the `--cpus=32` option.
* More than 128GB of RAM, include the `--memory=128g` option.

Refer to [What are license units and how do they apply to my cluster?](https://docs.singlestore.com/db/latest/introduction/faqs/general/#what-are-license-units-and-how-do-they-apply-to-my-cluster) for more information on license units and how they are calculated.
> **Note:**
> We recommend using an explicit image version tag whenever possible from the [list of image tags][versions] and/or [the changelog][changelog].

### How to run the Docker image on **Linux** or **Apple Intel**?

*See next section for Apple Silicon (M1/M2 chips) instructions.*

```bash
docker run \
    -d --name singlestoredb-dev \
    -e ROOT_PASSWORD="YOUR SINGLESTORE ROOT PASSWORD" \
    -p 3306:3306 -p 8080:8080 -p 9000:9000 \
    ghcr.io/singlestore-labs/singlestoredb-dev:latest
```

If you want to configure a specific license, simply pass it as an environment variable:

```bash
docker run \
    -d --name singlestoredb-dev \
    -e ROOT_PASSWORD="YOUR SINGLESTORE ROOT PASSWORD" \
    -e SINGLESTORE_LICENSE="YOUR SINGLESTORE LICENSE" \
    -p 3306:3306 -p 8080:8080 -p 9000:9000 \
    ghcr.io/singlestore-labs/singlestoredb-dev:latest
```

### How to run the Docker image on **Apple Silicon** (M1/M2 chips)?

First, make sure you are using Docker desktop which supports the latest virtualization technology on Apple Silicon machines.

Second, **you must enable "Use Virtualization framework" and "Use Rosetta for x86_64/amd64 emulation on Apple Silicon" in Docker Desktop preferences**. If you do not do this, SingleStore will run very slowly and consume a lot of power on your Mac. You can find these settings under Docker Desktop > Preferences > General.

![Screenshot of enabling the new Virtualization framework in Docker's preferences](.github/osx_docker_new_prefs.jpeg)

Third, run the following command to start SingleStore. Note the `--platform linux/amd64` instruction which is required when running on Apple Silicon.

```bash
docker run \
    -d --name singlestoredb-dev \
    -e ROOT_PASSWORD="YOUR SINGLESTORE ROOT PASSWORD" \
    --platform linux/amd64 \
    -p 3306:3306 -p 8080:8080 -p 9000:9000 \
    ghcr.io/singlestore-labs/singlestoredb-dev:latest
```

### How to run the Docker image on **Windows**?

Windows Powershell and Command Prompt (CMD) work best if you run the command on a single line. Alternatively you can use backticks for multi-line strings in Powershell. Either way, the following single-line version of the command will work on Windows.

```bash
docker run -d --name singlestoredb-dev -e ROOT_PASSWORD="YOUR SINGLESTORE ROOT PASSWORD" -p 3306:3306 -p 8080:8080 -p 9000:9000 ghcr.io/singlestore-labs/singlestoredb-dev:latest
```

## How to open a SQL shell?

The image includes a shell which you can run interactively using `docker exec` like so:

```bash
docker exec -it singlestoredb-dev singlestore -p
```

The above command will prompt you for the root password. You can also provide the root password at the command line immediately after the `-p` flag like so:

```bash
docker exec -it singlestoredb-dev singlestore -pYOUR_ROOT_PASSWORD
```

You can also connect to SingleStore using any MySQL compatible client on your own machine using the following connection details:

| Key      | Value              |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| Host     | 127.0.0.1          |
| Port     | 3306               |
| Username | root               |
| Password | YOUR_ROOT_PASSWORD |

## How to access the SingleStore Studio UI?

SingleStore Studio is a convenient way to manage SingleStoreDB and run queries via a browser based UI. Studio runs by default on port 8080 in the container. Assuming you have forwarded port 8080 to your local machine, you can access studio at http://localhost:8080.

When opening Studio you will see a login screen. Use the username `root` and the `ROOT_PASSWORD` you set when starting the container.

## Where can I learn how to use SingleStoreDB?

Now that you have SingleStore running, please check out the following sections of our official documentation for guides on what to do next.

 * [Connect to SingleStore](https://docs.singlestore.com/db/latest/connect-to-your-cluster/)
 * [Developer Resources](https://docs.singlestore.com/db/latest/developer-resources/)
 * [Integrations](https://docs.singlestore.com/db/latest/integrate-with-singlestore/)
 * [Load Data](https://docs.singlestore.com/db/latest/load-data/)

## How to access the Data API?

In addition to supporting the MySQL Protocol, SingleStore also has a JSON over HTTP protocol called the [Data API][data-api] which you can access at port 9000 in the container. Assuming you have forwarded port 9000 to your local machine, the following curl command demonstrates how you can use the Data API:

```bash
~ âžœ curl -s -XPOST -H "content-type: application/json" -d '{ "sql": "select 1" }' root:YOUR_ROOT_PASSWORD@localhost:9000/api/v1/query/rows
{
  "results": [
    {
      "rows": [
        {
          "1": 1
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

> **Note**
> For more information on how to use the Data API please [visit the documentation.][data-api]

## How to use WebAssembly (Wasm) backed functions?

The Code Engine feature in SingleStoreDB supports creating functions (UDFs and
TVFs) using code compiled to WebAssembly (Wasm). This feature supports any
language that can compile to the Wasm core specification, which allows you to
create UDFs in a language of your choice using existing code libraries and run
them in a sandboxed environment for enhanced security. It uses a linear memory
model and provides hard memory protection boundaries.

This Docker image has Wasm functions enabled by default. You can learn how to compile and load Wasm UDFs and UDAs into SingleStoreDB [on our docs][wasm].

## How to use Docker volumes for persistent storage?

> **Note**
> If you are [specifying a Singlestore version at runtime](#how-to-specify-a-singlestoredb-version-at-runtime), your data will always be overwritten when the container restarts each time, as the container will always attempt to re-download and re-initialise the installed version on each run.
>
> To get around this, build a [custom image](#how-to-build-a-custom-version-of-this-docker-image-with-a-specific-singlestoredb-version) with your specific version.

```bash
docker run \
    -d --name singlestoredb-dev \
    -e ROOT_PASSWORD="YOUR ROOT PASSWORD" \
    -p 3306:3306 -p 8080:8080 -p 9000:9000 \
    -v my_cool_volume:/data \
    ghcr.io/singlestore-labs/singlestoredb-dev
```

After creating the container with a volume, you can re-create the container using the same volume to keep your data around. This can be used to upgrade SingleStore to new versions without loosing your data. Keep in mind that SingleStoreDB does **not** support downgrading. Make sure to take a backup of the volume before running the upgrade.

> **Note**
> In order to mount a host volume to the `/data` directory, you will need to chown the volume to UID=999 and GID=998 before mounting it. The volume will be initialized automatically if empty. Host volumes are only supported by the `/data` directory.

This Docker image has a number of volume mount points in addition to `/data`. Here is a table outlining each of the mount points along with roughly their contents:

| mount path | description                                                                                                        |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| /data      | All of the data, config, and cache for the SingleStoreDB cluster.                                                  |
| /logs      | All of the tracelog files containing information that can help debug the cluster or observe it's current behavior. |
| /server    | The installation directory containing server binaries and other installation state.                                |

## How to initialize this container with a SQL file?

When this docker image starts for the first time it will check to see if an `init.sql` file exists in its filesystem. The default location is `/init.sh`, but it can be customized via the `INIT_SQL` environment variable. If `init.sql` is found, the container will run it against the database as soon as SingleStoreDB is ready.

One way to do this is mounting a `init.sql` from your machine into the container using the `-v` flag. Here is an example of doing this:

```bash
docker run \
    -d --name singlestoredb-dev \
    -e ROOT_PASSWORD="YOUR ROOT PASSWORD" \
    -p 3306:3306 -p 8080:8080 -p 9000:9000 \
    -v ${PWD}/test/init.sql:/init.sql \
    ghcr.io/singlestore-labs/singlestoredb-dev
```

Replace `${PWD}/test/init.sql` with an absolute path to the SQL file you want to initialize SingleStore with.

> **Note**
> `/init.sql` will only be run once. If you want to run it again you will need to delete the file `/data/.init.sql.done` and then restart the container.

## How to set SingleStoreDB Global Variables?

SingleStoreDB can be configured through the use of global variables which you can [find in our documentation here][global-vars]. These variables can be set using environment variables when running the SingleStoreDB Dev Image using the prefix `SINGLESTORE_SET_GLOBAL_`.

For example, if you want to set `default_partitions_per_leaf` to 1, you would do this:

```bash
docker run \
    -d --name singlestoredb-dev \
    -e ROOT_PASSWORD="YOUR ROOT PASSWORD" \
    -e SINGLESTORE_SET_GLOBAL_DEFAULT_PARTITIONS_PER_LEAF=1 \
    -p 3306:3306 -p 8080:8080 -p 9000:9000 \
    ghcr.io/singlestore-labs/singlestoredb-dev
```

Multiple environment variables can be specified if you want to configure multiple global variables in SingleStoreDB.

If you specify a variable which is not supported by SingleStoreDB, the image will fail to start. You can see the full error message by inspecting the failed docker container's logs using `docker log`.

## How to use a specific SingleStoreDB version?

The SingleStoreDB Dev Image uses the latest SingleStoreDB version available in the managed service by default. If you would prefer to use another SingleStoreDB version, you will need to either build a custom version of this image or specify the version at runtime by following the tutorials below.

### What are some known SingleStoreDB versions?

You can use the version numbers in the first column of the following table in order to run a specific version of SingleStoreDB. If you want to use a particular patch version, just specify that version instead.

| `SINGLESTORE_VERSION`                    | description                                                      |                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 8.7                                      | SingleStoreDB Self-Managed 8.7, see changelog for latest version | [changelog](https://docs.singlestore.com/db/v8.7/release-notes/singlestore-memsql/8-7-release-notes/maintenance-release-changelog-v-8-7/) |

### How to build a custom version of this Docker Image with a specific SingleStoreDB Version?

The script `/scripts/switch-version.sh` can be used to easily build a custom version of this image. The fastest way to do this is using Docker build like so:

```bash
cat <<EOF | docker build -f - -t singlestoredb-dev:custom .
FROM ghcr.io/singlestore-labs/singlestoredb-dev
RUN /scripts/switch-version.sh SINGLESTORE_VERSION SINGLESTORE_LICENSE
EOF
```

Make sure to replace `SINGLESTORE_VERSION` and `SINGLESTORE_LICENSE` with the SingleStore version you want to use (see table above) as well as your license key. After running this command, you will have a new docker image called `singlestoredb-dev:custom` with the specific version of SingleStoreDB installed and ready to use.

### How to specify a SingleStoreDB version at runtime?

In order to use a specific version of SingleStoreDB at runtime, you can start the Docker container with the `SINGLESTORE_VERSION` environment variable set.

> **Warning**
> This method will result in the container taking much longer to start (roughly a minute) because it has to download and install SingleStoreDB each time. For this reason, we recommend building a custom version of this Docker image using [the instructions above][custom image method].

Here is an example of using the `SINGLESTORE_VERSION` environment variable to run SingleStoreDB 8.7:

```bash
docker run \
    -d --name singlestoredb-dev \
    -e ROOT_PASSWORD="YOUR ROOT PASSWORD" \
    -e SINGLESTORE_VERSION="8.7" \
    -p 3306:3306 -p 8080:8080 -p 9000:9000 \
    ghcr.io/singlestore-labs/singlestoredb-dev
```

> **Note**
> You can mount `/server` into a Docker volume to preserve the installed SingleStoreDB server binaries if you are unable to use the [custom image method]. This will increase subsequent startup performance at the expense of complexity.

[custom image method]: #how-to-build-a-custom-version-of-this-docker-image-with-a-specific-singlestoredb-version

## How to use this container in a CI/CD environment?

This Docker image defines a healthcheck which runs every 5 seconds. Any CI/CD system or container runtime which respects the healthcheck should automatically wait for SingleStore to be running and healthy.

### How to run SingleStoreDB in Github Actions?

Here is an example workflow which runs SingleStore as a container service and queries it from the job.

```yaml
name: my-workflow
on: push

jobs:
  my-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build-image

    services:
      singlestoredb:
        image: ghcr.io/singlestore-labs/singlestoredb-dev
        ports:
          - 3306:3306
          - 8080:8080
          - 9000:9000
        env:
          ROOT_PASSWORD: test
          # Optional:
          # SINGLESTORE_LICENSE: ${{ secrets.SINGLESTORE_LICENSE }}

    steps:
      - name: sanity check using mysql client
        run: |
          mysql -u root -ptest -e "SELECT 1" -h 127.0.0.1
```

### How to run SingleStoreDB in Gitlab CI/CD?

Here is an example workflow which runs SingleStore as a service and queries it from the job. Unfortunately Gitlab does not support Docker healthchecks for services, so additional logic must be added to wait for SingleStore to be ready. There is a [three year old issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/3984) to address this problem in Gitlab, so hopefully this can be simplified eventually.

> **Note**
> You can add your SingleStore license key to Gitlab secrets under the key `SINGLESTORE_LICENSE`.

```yaml
image: debian

stages:
  - test

variables:
    ROOT_PASSWORD: test
    # Optional:
    # SINGLESTORE_LICENSE: $SINGLESTORE_LICENSE

testing:
  stage: test
  services:
    - name: ghcr.io/singlestore-labs/singlestoredb-dev:latest
      alias: singlestoredb-dev
  script:
    - apt update
    - apt install -y mariadb-client curl
    - curl -sI localhost:8080 --retry 30 --retry-connrefused --retry-delay 1
    - mysql -u root -ptest -h singlestoredb-dev -e "create database foo"
    - mysql -u root -ptest -h singlestoredb-dev -e "create table foo.bar (id int)"
    - mysql -u root -ptest -h singlestoredb-dev -e "insert into foo.bar values (1),(2),(3)"
    - mysql -u root -ptest -h singlestoredb-dev -e "select * from foo.bar"
```

## How to upgrade from `singlestore/cluster-in-a-box`?

Before this image existed, there was another Docker Image called `singlestore/cluster-in-a-box`. The docker run command for the previous image looked something like this:

```bash
docker run -i --init \
    --name singlestore-ciab \
    -e LICENSE_KEY=${LICENSE_KEY} \
    -e ROOT_PASSWORD=${ROOT_PASSWORD} \
    -p 3306:3306 -p 8080:8080 \
    singlestore/cluster-in-a-box
```

The differences between the old image and the new image are the following:

 * The image no longer needs to be initialized before you can use it
 * Startup time is much better - roughly 5 seconds with the new image versus a minute with the old image
 * The [Data API][data-api] and External Functions features are enabled by default
 * Upgrade between versions is supported and tested (downgrade is not supported)
 * The new image is distributed through the Github Container Repository rather than the Docker Hub

In all cases we recommend using the new image unless you need to run a older version of SingleStore which has not been released in `singlestoredb-dev-image`.

## Apple Silicon (M1/M2 chips) performance notes

In order to support running SingleStoreDB on Apple Silicon many of our performance optimizations are disabled. This can result in unexpectedly bad performance, especially during recovery (restarting SingleStoreDB) and when running queries for the first time.

To tune this performance impact (either faster or slower) you can change the number of cores and amount of RAM allocated to the Docker virtual machine by [following the documentation here][docker-resource-docs].
